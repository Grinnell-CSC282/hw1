/* To remove trailing whitespace from a given file, you can use sed in the following way from the terminal. */

sed -i 's/[ \t]*$//' FILE_NAME

/* With sed, the 's/.../.../' is a substitute command. Essentially, you substitute the whitespace up until the 
line-terminating character with nothing, basically deleting it. The -i flag is the insertion mode for sed which makes
this possible. The *$ limits this substitution to only whitespace and tabs at the end of the line. */

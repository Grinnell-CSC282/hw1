My original thought was that perhaps foo or bar
were somehow continuing to use part of the allocated
memory after they finished running. That seemed
pertty far-fetched, however, and after perusing
the solutions provided by some of my classmates, I
think Andrew probably has the right idea--foo and/
or bar are using memory beyond the allocated space.
